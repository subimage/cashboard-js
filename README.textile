h1. Cashboard-js

This project is the official Javascript wrapper for the "Cashboard API":http://api.cashboardapp.com created and maintained by "Subimage LLC":http://www.subimage.com.

"Cashboard":http://www.getcashboard.com is an online service that allows you to track time, create estimates, invoice your clients, and collect payments via credit cards or PayPal.

Cashboard-js uses the JSON data format to speak to the Cashboard API.

h2. Purpose

The aim of this project is to provide a quick and simple way to use the Cashboard API from javascript widgets, mobile devices, and other lightweight clients. We will most likely be using it for any new Apple Dashboard Widgets or small client apps we develop in house.

Cashboard-js doesn't leverage a framework like "prototype.js":http://www.prototypejs.org/, "jquery":http://jquery.com/, or "mootools":http://mootools.net/ so you can hopefully mix and match it with your favorite framework of choice.

h2. Roadmap

I'd like to get around to this sooner or later.

# A testing framework of some sort and actual unit tests :)
# Automated build script that combines all JS files and minifies them
