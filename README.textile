h1. Cashboard-js

This project is the official Javascript wrapper for the "Cashboard API":http://api.cashboardapp.com created and maintained by "Subimage LLC":http://www.subimage.com.

"Cashboard":http://www.getcashboard.com is an online service that allows you to track time, create estimates, invoice your clients, and collect payments via credit cards or PayPal.

Cashboard-js uses the JSON data format to speak to the Cashboard API.

h2. Purpose

The aim of this project is to provide a quick and simple way to use the Cashboard API from javascript widgets, mobile devices, and other lightweight clients.

Cashboard-js doesn't leverage a framework like "prototype.js":http://www.prototypejs.org/, "jquery":http://jquery.com/, or "mootools":http://mootools.net/ so you can hopefully mix and match it with your favorite framework of choice.
